            <div class="dis">
                <p>Yeah... So, what is Special Edition?<br>
                I guess we don't have much to tell. First of all,
                listen carefully, Owners of this website is just me and my sister.
                I and my sis are the only people who run and maintain this website.
                Special Edition includes only the stories which are narrated by us.
                These are the stories which you can't find on other websites.
                Stories which are created and narrated by me and my sis.
                You can find trendy stories in our Special Editions.
                So, that's good description of Special Edition.
                Hey, please kindly bare with our narration and spelling mistakes.
                I know I don't type good. But, for sure, you can find good stories in Special Editions
                according to me. Thanks to read this!</p>

        <div class="age">
            <h1>Age limit to read these stories.</h1>
            <div class="limit">
                <p>I prefer people to follow age limit for websites.<br>
                 Few websites may cross age limit of viewing the website.
                To this website we prefer people who <br>
                are elder than the age of 7. Few stories <br>
                contain ghost scenes, we prefer 13 plus people to read them.
                But if few kids who are below 7 are really willing <br>
                to read it, yes it is absolutely fine if they are not afraid of ghosts.<br>
                Never mind!, We give an alert of age when ever you read a story.</p>
