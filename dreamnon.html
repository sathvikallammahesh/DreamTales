                <p>In the story, miracles which happened to the children were not a dream. It was true!<br>
                (it was actually true in the story.)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story">
                <p>I still don't know how it ends, I fell scared!
                Okay look, my name is Chris. I just want 
                you to know what had happened to me and my friends.
            This one is a long story, and I still don't know what might happen next. I'm ready to take my next step.
            All this took place very quietly, It was very good at the beginning. Never mind! Let me narrate it!</p>

                <p>My name is Chris, I live in a gated comunity named Stephen's Community. We live in an own house. Let me tell you about my family:
                    I live with my Father, Sister, Grand-mother and Mother. There are twelve buildings in our community. I usually don't go out, so I 
                    play with my friends who live with me in my community. Let me tell you about my friends: James, Charlie and billy. To me I feel
                    Billy is the best of all. He is really kind in nature and has kind heart. Well to talk about other two people, they are not so good.
                    Whatever! Let's just head towards what had happened.
                </p>

        <div class="dis">
            <p>We live in a rich home, So I guess you can figure out what facilities we use. Beside our home, there
                was a construction going on. No one even told us what that was! People said the construction was a secret!
                Secret? I hate secrets! When I hear the word secret, I feel like to know what it is. (I know, everyone have the same feeling to know the secret!)
                But I'm a bit different. I guess some one of you will have that feeling which cannnot be controlable.
                Days passed by, finally the construction site was completed! We were very eager to know what that is!
                Wait what! That was an airport! Now I guess that the land owners near the airport might have good demand for land.
                When I took my first look at the airport, I felt like to board a plane.
                Finally it was time to sleep. I grabed my personal diary and wrote what had happened the whole day.

            <p>Wake up sleeping snout!!! said my sister, Oh, okay it was morning 10 P.M. It was a Sunday! I could go out and play the whole day!
                You know, I am more kind like playing guy. I just got out from my bed and freshed up myself. I let my way out to play with my friends.
                When I was going to my friends building, I saw a girl who wore white frock. "Who is this girl? I never saw her before though I live in this community!" I said
                it myself. I met my friend Billy and told him about the girl. He said "She might be a relative of someone who came here to visit them."
                We both went on to meet our other friends.

            <h1>Chapter four</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="st4">
            <p>The last day, me and my friends played for a long time. We enjoyed a lot! Today it is Monday, I need to attend my school.
                On my way to school, I met the girl whom I saw yesterday. I felt a bit negative when I met her.
                It feels like she is kind like horrorful! Anyway, that's not gonna happen. I followed my daily rotten in the school.
                When I came back home, I saw my friends reading books. I asked them "Hey guys! Didn't you guys go to school today?".
                "Yes Chris! We all thought of not going to school today, Before we  could come to your home, we've seen you going to school. So we did not ask you
                to not go to school." This incident surprised me! My friends never behaved like this!
                They always go to school and they never did anything without me! I told them to complete their homework and then come to my home.
                They agreed.
                Later then, we people started playing. All of a sudden someone called out "Billy!", who is it? It was the girl whom I met morning!
                I'm sorry to say this, I don't remember the girl's name. I asked Billy what is it with the girl, he told "I don't even know her!
                And I don't know how she know my name!" "This is going crazy!" I said myself.
                That girl said "My name is angel, I'm new here! Nice to meet you guys!" I told "pleasure to meet you too! By the way, how do you know
                Billy's name?" "Well, his mother told me about him, I live in the same floor so she just said me that I could play with him."
                I felt safe! She is not a ghost!
                It was 4:30 P.M. My friend James told that he knew a place which is haunted! I told "let's go there"
                Other friends were a bit afraid of horror! They refused to come. So I and James decided to visit the place!
                Angel also wished to come with us, we three went to the place.
                When I gave my first look to that house, I felt nothing like haunted.
                But, it is a bit like a scary house. More than me and James, Angel was surprised!
                We asked her what had happened, she repplied that she used to live in that house!
                I felt like she might be angry at James cause he called her previous house as a haunted house.
                Without saying a word, Angel just left the place and went back home.

            <p>Oh god! Things were going crazy! My parents booked few tickets to board a plane to Sydney!
                Not only my parents, My friends parents also booked tickets for the same flight!
                My sister was excited about the trip! I applied for a 2 week holidays in school.
                Now, there is no problem to board the flight. It was morning 11:00 A.M, we boarded the plane
                with my friends. I guess I too feel excited too! An airhostess told everyone that she had an announcement to the passangers,
                she told that the flight was postponned to 12:00 P.M.
                We weren't sad cause it was just an hour delay. We all went back to the Airport.
                You know what, My home is about a 200 meters away from airport. It don't take me more than 4 mins to go to my home.
                I actually forgot my diary at home! I can't write my day in that if I don't have it!
                I told my parents that I will be back in 10 minutes. I ran to my home without thinking!
                I used to have a spare home key in a secret box in my cycle.
                I need to go to my cycle and open my secret box to get my home key.
                It was in the basement of my appartment.
                There are two basements in our community, My cycle is in the basement-2. I reached basement-2,
                my cycle was not there! My diary is very important to me, so I need the key to open my house lock.
                Who even wishes for my cycle? Who could have taken it? What to do now?
                When I was rushing to basement-1, I saw a basement-3!!!!!!!!!!!
                This is impossible! How could a new basement be in a community?
                I felt scared now, I saw nothing in the new basement except my cycle!
                I dared to go there, I entered beasement-3! I saw a dark shadow near to my cycle!
                I asked, "Who are you? What do you want? How did my cycle come here?"
                Someone laughed in a threatning way!
                I was freked out now!!!
                Some kind of noise was coming from my back. When I looked around, the basement was closing!
                If it closes, I will be trapped!
                I ran as fast as I can but, The basement was closed!
                A dark thing with white eyes was staring at me!
                I could see its white eyes so clearly! I think it is a ghost for sure!
                I took my cycle and started cycling the whole basement to find any other way to go out!
                That white eyes guy was chasing me!!!! My heart was beating so fast!
                I quickly took my mobile with my hand and called my parents, it said contact not reachable!
                I tried to my friends, none of them answered!
                At last, I was cycling the whole time! I was scared!
                Finally, I recived a call from Billy! "Hello Billy! Hello! Can you hear me? I don't know what, but I'm being chased by someone!
                It does look like ghost!" "Dude are you crazy! What do you mean? Comon Chris, this is not the time to joke! The plane will leave in 10 minutes, please
                come fast!" And then he ended the call!
                I turned back and saw nothing! That white thing is no long chasing me!
                For a moment I got a relief! I finally figured a way out!
                (You might be thinking that, did he take his diary?) No, not at all! I can't think of my diary in this situtation!
                I parked my cycle in basement-2 and ran to the airport.
                At last, I some how managed to reach my flight! My parents scolded me! "Where did you go? The plane was about to leave!" said
                my sister. I can't speak a word cause I'm in a thrill!
