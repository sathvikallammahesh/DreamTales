                As you know that I'm so thriled, I finally got a relief after spending some time with my sister.
                I can't belive what happened to me in basement-3. What could I do? No one could belive me though I tell this.
                My friend Charlie came to me and told that there was a person at the last back seat of this flight who was staring Charlie for a long time!
                I casually went to that person and told him "Hi!" When he took a look towards me, his eyes became white!!
                I was way more frightned now! Not that white eyes guy again! He told "Next time for sure, I will catch you!".
                This made me feel like my face was pale. I had no words to say! I went back to my seat and looked at him. He was curiously staring at me!
                I quickly took a picture of him with my Camera. And acted with everyone like nothing had happened!
