        <p>Once there lived an old couple in a village. They used to live happily with what they have.
        One day, the wife thought of baking ginger bread and make her husband happy. She mixed the dough to make ginger bread.
        She moulded the dough into a shape of man and added few edible things. This made the bread-man look cute and neat.
        She kept the ginger bread man into the oven and waited for a while. Finally, something smelled delicious! It was the bread man!
        The old woman felt quite happy, she wore a rubber glove and took the bread out. All of a sudden, Ginger man woke up and rushed out of the house.
        This moment made the old lady astonished! She started running to catch the bread man. The old lady shouted, "Wait you Ginger made man! I need to get you!".
        The ginger bread man saw the old lady running and told "Run, run as fast as you can you can't catch me I'm the ginger bread man!".
        The old lady was running behind ginger bread man. Her husband saw her running and he joined her too.He asked her what had happened.
         His wife replied, "I had bakked a ginger bead which is shaped like a man, All of a sudden it had escaped!". "Okay, let's get him!".
        both of them are behind ginger bread man! Once again, bread man repllied "Run, run as fast as you can you can't catch me I'm the ginger bread man!".
        All of them were running. On the way there was a cow which was grazing.  It saw the couple and the bread man running. It thought of it'self that,
        "I guess ginger bread taste tasty! Let me get him!" So the couple and the cow were running behind ginger bread man.
        Same like the cow, A group of pigs noticed ginger bread man and  the other behind them. The pigs also want to taste bread man and so ran behind him.
        (Let's not make the story long) Like this, a horse and a hen also want to eat the ginger bread man and so ran for him.
        Now the couple,cow,pigs,horse and the hen were wanting to eat ginger bread man. Finally the ginger bread man has come to an end of river.
        It need to go across the river in order to escape. But, the problem here is that he will get drowned and die. There was a fox sitting aside of him.
        The fox offered bread man that he can help the bread man cross the river. Ginger bread man was intillegent, it told the fox "Thankyou for your offer! But,you will for sure eat me."
        (here the fox is more intillegent than bread man.) "Oh boy! I promise that I don't eat you! I was anyhow going to pass the river." said the fox.
        Poor ginger bread man has bellived fox words. He sat on the fox back. Both of them started crossing the river.
        (The fox was having a plan to eat him!) The fox told him that he was felling a bit uncomfortable and asked him to sit on his neck. Bread man agreed.
        After passing half way, the fox asked him to move and sit on his snout. Bread man has moved to fox's neck. After a while, the fox tossed bread man in the 
        air and chewed him in his mouth. All this shows us the innocence of bread man and cruelness of fox. Finally ginger bread man ended his life.</p>
