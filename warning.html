            <h1>This story contains ghost content.<br>
                 We prefer this as a 13 plus age group story.<br>
                 Few chapters in the story might have ghost pictures<br> 
                 which are scary and we prefer teenagers to view it.<br>
                 We actually have a non picture form of the story,<br> 7 plus age group people can view it and read it.<br>
                If you are still fine with the age group, 
                go ahed and continue to read your story.</h1>
